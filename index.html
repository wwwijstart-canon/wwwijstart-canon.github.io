            <h2>How to Install the Canon Printer Driver on Your MAC Device?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Ensure the Canon printer driver setup file is in your Mac device. Locate it and run the file by pressing "Start setup."</li>
                <li>Click on the "Continue" button, then tap "Next."</li>
                <li>The system will fetch the details of the latest software and drivers.</li>
                <li>You have to carefully choose the "country/region" and left-click on the "Next" button to proceed further.</li>
                <li>A license agreement will pop up in front of you; read the text given in the contract very carefully. If you agree with the text, click "YES."</li>
                <li>Then, you have to select the type of connection method you will be using to connect the printer and the Mac device. Choose one from "Wireless network," "Wired LAN connection," and "USB Connection."</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
<h3>Wired LAN Connection</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Once you have selected the Wired LAN connection (Ethernet Cable), click on the "Next" option.</li>
                <li>At this point, check if the printer is powered and turned on.</li>
                <li>Tap the "Next" tab.</li>
                <li>The wizard will search for the printer connected to the device by any means.</li>
                <li>The installation application will then show the name of your canon printer on the screen. If the wizard does not reveal your printer in the list, then tap on "search for IP address" and follow the prompts appearing on the screen to complete the step that way.</li>
                <li>Select your Canon printer on the list and then click the "Next" button.</li>
                <li>The setup guide will appear in front of you. To set up the printer, you need to follow the in-wizard prompts.</li>
  
            </ol>
            <br>
            <h3>USB Connection</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Click on the "Next" button after you have selected USB Connection.</li>
                            <li>Tap on "Install this driver software anyway," then the driver installation process will start.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that the printer is tightly connected with the system via USB cable.</li>
                            <li>In case you are unable to proceed after the Connection via USB cable, then click on the "Troubleshooting" option.</li>
                            <li>Keep in mind that the setting up procedure for printers lacking wireless capabilities is relatively straightforward.</li>
                            <li>After the Canon printer driver is installed on the Mac device, the wizard asks you to add your printer to your MAC device. Press the "Add Printer" option to move forward.</li>
                            <li>The wizard may show you numerous printer devices on the list to add, locate and select the model number of your printer and then press "Add."</li>
                            <li>Lastly, you need to tap the cursor on the "Next" button to complete the installation and setup process of your wireless Canon printer on the Mac device.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Wi-Fi Connection</h3>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Go through the steps if you choose Wireless Connection in "Select Connection Method."</li>
                                        <li>Select Wi-Fi connection under "Select Connection Method" and Press the "Next" button.</li>
                                        <li>At this point, make sure that the printer is turned on.</li>
                                        <li>The wizard will search for the printer device connected to the same wireless Connection with which the Mac device is connected.</li>
                                        <li>The printer's name will appear on the list, locate and select the printer. Then press "Next" on the wizard to proceed.</li>

            <h2>Troubleshooting Tips</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>You need to ensure the power supply connection is made correctly and tightly and the AC supply socket button is turned on. Also, check if you have turned on the power button of the Canon printer. (Note - If you are printing bulky graphics or documents, the printer may take a long time to process it. The power lamp flashes when the printer processes the data to be printed)</li>
                <li>You should check the connection between the printer and the computer system before dispatching the command to print. In case you are using a USB cable, check the connection on both ends of the cable. If you are using a wireless printer, check that the printer is correctly set up for use, including the printer's visibility.</li>
                <li>Check if the printer driver matches the printer device you are using to print the document by selecting the name of your device in the print dialog.</li>
                <li>You have to check if the media type and the setting of the page size for that printer driver are correct. The A4 size should be selected in the application. Paper loaded in the printer should be in correspondence with the media type specified in the printer driver.</li>
                <li>Ensure that the output rack of the printer is in its usual position, as it hinders the printing. Therefore, the printer will not take the command to print the document.</li>
                <li>If you have applied the above troubleshooting measures, try rebooting your computer system and try printing again.</li>
            </ol>
